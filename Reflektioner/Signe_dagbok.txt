v.1 
We've made sure all group members have a github account. That alone proved to be a challenge.

With github in place, we've prepared directories for reflections, containers and planning according to the specifics of the assignment.
We've also made directories for the database and server that we will need later.

We've made out first commits and everything seems to be working.

The git commands used are:

git clone - making a clone of the branch.
git commit  - för att commita det vi gjort. Viktigt här att beskriva sitt commit enligt instruktionerna, något vi implementerar från start.
git commit - commit changes to the branch you´re working in. It's important to describe the commit as it is part of the examination, something we'er implementing in the group from start.
git add - add changes
git switch - switch branch
git fetch - updates remote tracking branches
git merge - merge branches
git pull - combines git fetch and git merge to update the local branch with changes

Our aim is to keep a main branch without faults, alas the maintenance branch! This is where we vill make all changes and make sure everything is working before merging it with the main branch. 
We're also planning on not working in the same file at the same time to avoid conflicts.

The difficulties I've encountered so far is using the git commands in the right way and felling comfortable in the environment we're working with. It's the first time I've used github, but I think I'm
getting the hang of it now. I just need to remember to git pull after git fetch! A mistake I've made, and won't make again.

As we're just in the beginning of the process there are parts of the assignment that I'm not sure how to solve yet. I'm not yet comfortable with using containers and databases so that might prove a challenge.
