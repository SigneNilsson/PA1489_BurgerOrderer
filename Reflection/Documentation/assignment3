försöka skriva automatiserade testet när det passar under tiden
-testa så att burger orderer fungerar med sida i localhost
-testa så att kitchenview fugnerar med sida i localhost
-testa submitknappen genom klicka och se om information skickas vidare.
-testa databasuppkoppling
-testa använda information från databas i utskrifter.


15/10 tried using pytest to make automated tests. We started by installing pytest using pip install and creating a simple test file to try it out. Unfortunately it does not seem to work at all initially. 
Will come back with entry when it's working.
