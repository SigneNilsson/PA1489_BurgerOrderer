Brief summary of what configuration management is and why
used:

Configuration management means systematically managing and documenting all components and their relationships within a system. This includes keeping track of changes, versions and status of each component.
Configuration management makes it possible to track all changes made to the system, contributes to the system's structure and status, and by continuously documenting the configuration of the system, we ensure that the system works as expected and that all components are compatible with each other.


-Brief summary about the most common workflow with git, including those
git commands used;
the most common workflow with git starts with cloning a repository, creating a new branch, creating files, making changes, saving the changes, adding the changes, commiting the changes and sending the changes, downloading and uploading them and merging with the current branch.

git clone      - repository
git switch     - new branch
git branch     - checks current branch
git add        - new file
git commit     - saves made changes
git fetch      - fetches others changes
git push       - sends your changes
git merge      - merge branches
git pull       - pulls others changes

Mostafa= It was easy to create the github account, repository and create files.


-What went less well?
